excerpt: "In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-powered automation, Microsoft offers two powerful yet distinct tools â€” Power Automate and Copilot Studio. While both aim to streamline workflows, they serve fundamentally different purposes. Power Automate excels at task automation, connecting apps and services to execute repetitive workflows, whereas Copilot Studio specializes in conversational AI, building intelligent agents that interact with users naturally."
